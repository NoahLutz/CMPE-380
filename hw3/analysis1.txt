To analyze the speed of the C an C++ program, the timing macros in Timers.h
were used to see how much time each program took to load all data and then
to compute the linear line of best fit. It was found that for the C program,
it took around 44ms on average to completley read and load the data for
batch processing and 0.312ms on average to calculate the coefficients for
the line of best fit. For the C++ program, it took on average 3.69ms to
read all the data for batch processing and 0.459ms on average to compute
the coefficients. The biggest diffence shows up in the ammount of time to
read the file and load all the data. This is due to the fact that C++ has
much better file I/O than C does. Also, the difference between the
computation times can be attributed to the fact that C++ has slightly more
overhead due to the fact that its an object oriented language. 

To compare the size differences between the C and C++ programs, both ls and
size command line utilities were used. It was found that the C++ program
was significantly larger than the C program. This makes sense because C++
is object oriented, meaning there is more overhead, making the code size
larger.
