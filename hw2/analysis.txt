Running debugTst divide through gdb and using the run command, it was 
found that the program crashed on line 24 of debugTst.c. Setting a 
breakpoint for line 24, re-running the debug session and printing the 
variables using the info locals command, it was found that number had the 
value of 100. Running debugTst through valgrind with leak check enabled, 
it was found that debugTst leaks 2048 bytes with the memory argument. 
When re-run using the "good" argument, 0 bytes were in use at the time 
that the program stoped running.
