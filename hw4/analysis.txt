The Linked List was implemented using a doubly linked list where each node
points to the next node, the previous node and contains a pointer to the
actual data. When this implementation was compared to the DynamicArray
implementation, it was observed that it took significantly less time to
read the data into the linked list than the dynamic array and it takes
significantly less time to search the dynamic array. The times are listed
below:
Linked List Read: 56.6 ms
Dynamic Array Read: 120.1 ms
Linked List Search: 7.73 ms
Dynamic Array Search: 3.722 ms

This effect is expected because, when reading words into dynamic array, 
when it needs to grow the array, it performs a realloc to move the whole
block of data which is time intensive, whereas the linked list simply
mallocs another node for the data. Likewise, the search through the dynamic
array is much quicker becuause all the data is contiguous in memory where
with the linked list, it needs to jump around much more than they dynamic 
array.
