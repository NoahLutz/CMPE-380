QuadraticSolver.c

The first two equations that were passed into QuadraticSolver produced
the expected output. The third equation that was passed into QuadraticSolver
produced an unexpected error. This was due to the fact that the coefficient
for the x^2 term was a zero. The way the roots are calculated does not take
into account the possibility of one of the parameters being set to zero. This
caused the roots to be printed as "inf" and "nan".
